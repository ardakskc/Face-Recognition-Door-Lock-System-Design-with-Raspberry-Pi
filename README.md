Face Recognition Door Lock System Design with Raspberry Pi 

We use FaceRecognitioner and Haarcscade for analyse given faces. After the analysis of the faces, the results are recorded in the matrix. The camera is always on and scans the faces found. If a registered face is detected, the lock is unlocked.
